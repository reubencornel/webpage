TITLE:About Me
CONTENT_START:
BEGINP
I was born one sunny afternoon during the winter of 1983 in Mumbai. After two years my
parents shifted to Hyderabad because, Dad's company opened up a new
branch in Hyderabad and he was supposed to set up the unit. We were in
Hyderabad for 10 years. During that time, I did my schooling in Little
Flower High school then at St. Patrick's High School. I don't have many
memories about the place. But I made a very close friend whom I still
like to keep in touch.

It was in 1995 that Dad's company decided to unify all their divisions
in Bangalore and that year we moved to Bangalore. This was probably
one of the most important decision we made and we don't regret
it. I did my schooling at Bethany High School, Koramangala. This is
where I received enlightenment about computers sitting on under one of the
nodes of the lan in school in deep meditation. I owe this realisation to my head of the
computer science department, Pankaj sir.

I finished my 10th standard under the ICSE board in 1998. After this I
joined Christ College for first and second PUC. This is equivalent to
11th and 12th standard in ICSE and CBSE. My specialization was
Electronics. To be honest in the beginning I actually cribbed about
taking the subject. I wanted to join St. Josephs which had computer
Science. But I took up Christ College. Though it was not very easy, it
went on well. But then I realized it made life really easy for me in
engineering because we had a subject on electronics, and more over it
helped me develop another hobby. I learned how to build hobby
circuits. I must say that is an interesting hobby.

I used to work for a company called <a
href="http://www.thbs.com">Torry Harris Business Solutions</a> as a
software engineer, guess I was pretty good cause they gave me a
certificate that said nice things about me. But
then one fine day inspiration to do my masters hit me and right now
I'm at the Computer science department of North Carolina State
University doing my masters in Computer Science. I'm really interested
in Artificial Intelligence.

I also interned at <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign Inc</a>
over the summer of 2008 and again since I did a good job my very nice
manager told me that I could work for them over Fall too I agreed
cause I had tonnes of fun working there. I really enjoyed my work at
Verisign, met some really nice people, learnt quite a lot and most
importantly I visited almost all the Smithsonian Museums.

 I love programming, making circuits, long distance cycling, <a
 href="http:/www.fsf.org">free software</a>, Linux. I'm proud to say
 that I'm a member of the church choir. I <b>hate</b> lazy people,
 hypocrites, and politicians of all sizes and shapes.

I swear by the emacs text editor, because of its extreme versatility
and programability. Configuring emacs is an art in its self. I have
put up my <a href="https://github.com/reubencornel/emacs-config">insanely large emacs config</a> on this site. It was
originally culled of another site. I have made some additions to the
file which you probably might not have on your computer. This may
cause a bit of trouble when starting the editor. Commenting the
appropriate lines will prevail over all evil.

I'm currently working on the cogworks project that contributes towards the requirements for my thesis. This project touches on aspects of cognitive modelling, software engineering, computer supported collaborative work and knowledge representation. My advisor is <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~stamant/">Robert St. Amant</a>. We published a <a href="RC-RSA-JS.pdf">paper based on the work</a> I had done, it won the best paper award at the Brims 2010 conference at Charleston, SC.

BEGINP
All boys love their toys...(no pun intended you pervert), so do I.
I have my little favourite Casio Pocket Viewer(PV) to keep me company,
at any time of the day or night. It is a Casio S-660. This is probably
one of the most handy things anybody could have.

The advantages of this model are 
<ul>
<li>It runs on a couple of AAA size batteries, for nearly 180 hours
on time.</li>
<li>It stores data in the flash memory. That means when your batteries
die, your data is safe.</li>
<li>It has a SDK which comes along with it. Which mean you can program
it to bend to your will.(I have always liked subjugating men and machines
to my will)</li>
<li>A number of programs are avaliable for this on the net. Though there
is a slight problem. All the bloody sites are in russian.</li>
<ul>

This project was also done during the 6th semester as a 
part of the curriculum. The main thing about this was that the 
project implementation was compelete in barely 3 days. Though it 
was so fast it was comfortably one of the most stable and 
best looking projects in the class. Some of the features of the 
project were that the image icons were not written as code as 
done in some editors. As as example if other people have to write a 
button with an icon on it the icon is written as a part of 
the code which makes moving the button to some 
other part of the screen if necessary very difficult. This 
project again was implemented using C++ becuse of the object 
oriented features provided by the language. This is one project that 
I can say is totally object oriented. Even the mouse pointer was an 
object.

Below I will discuss some of the implementation issues.

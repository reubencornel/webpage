TITLE:Database Project
CONTENT_START:Sangeet
BEGINP
This project is called Sangeet and was done in my 6th semester as a
part of the database project. The main purpose of the project was to
serve as a music store management software. It was <b>completely</b>
implemented in Linux.
ENDP
BEGINP
It provided features which other projects provided apart from that it
had a feature to rip 30 seconds of every track from a CD and make an
entry in the database.  When a user wanted to sample a song he could
search the database and play back the required song. The reports were
implemented using <GLOSSARY perl>.

BEGINP
I put too many details about the project as it was designed
graphically. I can assist you by putting up some places where you can
look for reading material.

CONTENT_START:PostgreSQL Rant
BEGINP
First I implemented the project using My SQL. But then at a later
stage I found out that it did not fully support the standard SQL. That
means no things like views, actions etc... Then I switched to
PostgreSQL. The problem was that some SQL queries were not compatible
so I changed them. After compiling I realised that the bloody project
refused to connect the database. I was getting desperate. So after
searching the net like crazy I came across a solution. And here it is.

BEGINP
1) Login as root and su into the user postgres SEP
2) Create a new user account in the database using
<b>createuser</b> SEP
3) Type <b>exit</b> at the prompt so that you are back as root. SEP
4) Edit a file in the path <b>/var/lib/postgres/data</b> called
<b>postgresql.conf</b> SEP
5) Edit the section of the file which is <b>Connection and
Authentication</b>. And uncomment all the lines in  this section. SEP
6) Save and exit this file. In the same path there will be another
file called <b>pg_hba.conf</b> edit this file and make the following
entry SEP
local  all all trust SEP
7) Save and quit the editor. SEP
8) Restart the database server.

CONTENT_START:Reading Material
BEGINP
To start up I hope you are thorough with your DBMS basics. This is
probably one of the most important requirements. For documentation on
how to use the QT toolkit the best place is the on line help which is
available with QT designer. Work out 2 or 3 examples till you manage
to get  the hang of it.

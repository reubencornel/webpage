* Cooking!!!

# no-toc

I acquired a taste for cooking after landing up in the US. Mainly because there is an absolute lack of exotic food around here. Although I did start cooking quite late compared to my comrades I guess I turned out to be a pretty reasonable cook.

On this page I will put up new recipies as I try them out and perhaps ifI have the time I will prehaps write a review about them.

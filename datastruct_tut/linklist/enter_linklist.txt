TITLE:Enter Link Lists
CONTENT_START:
BEGINP
We already have seen how effective using array were in handling 
data structures. Now we shall see how we can tackle the similar 
program using linklists.
ENDP

BEGINP
Link lists are essentially a list of dynamically allocated nodes of
memory. These nodes are generally C structures that consist of the
data of the node and one or more pointers depending on the type of
data structure. Below shown is a typical example of a node in a link
list.
CODE_START
struct node{
int n;
struct node *next;
};
CODE_END
ENDP


BEGINP
All linklists have almost the similar operations. If you manage to get 
the hang of using a singly linked list getting on to doubly linked 
lists and other data structures would be a piece of cake.
ENDP

BEGINP
The main operation that could be performed on a link list are SEP
1) Adding Elements the end of the list.SEP
2) Adding Elements to the begining of the list SEP
3) Adding Elements in the middle of the list SEP
4) Deleting elements from the above said positions.
ENDP

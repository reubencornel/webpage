TITLE:Link list Tutorial
CONTENT_START:
BEGINP
This is a basic tutorial on how to create link lists in C and C++. I
assume you are quite comfortable with pointers. If not I suggest you
read the book BOLD Pointers in C by Yashwant Kanetkar ENDBOLD. If you
have higher 
IQ level I suggest you read chapter 5 of <b>The C Programming Language
by Kernighan and Ritchie</b>.
ENDP
BEGINP
I might put up a pointer tutorial at some later point of
time. Anyways, this tutorial  starts off by explaing the need for link
lists then it explains how you  can perform various operations on
simple linked lists.

Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate using the LIFO principle. More explicitly LIFO stands for "last in first out", which in stack language translates as when someone calls a DELETE operation on a stack the element that was most recently inserted gets deleted. 
</P>
<P>
The insert on a stack is termed Push and the delete operation is termed Pop. As an analogy consider piling books such that they are one on top of each other, so when you do a push on this stack you place a book on top the pile and pray that it does not topple over. When you do a Pop the topmost book of the pile is removed. 
</P>
<P>
A stack has an attribute called <i>top</i> that points to the topmost element of the stack. When <i>top</i> is zero then the stack is empty.  
</P>
<P>
There are two main error conditions to be concerned about when dealing with stacks  
</P>
<P>
<ul>   <li><b>Underflow:</b> This happens when you try to pop an element of   the stack when the stack is empty</li> <li><b>Overflow:</b> This happens when you push an element on to a   already full stack</li> </ul> 
</P>
<P>
The pseudo code below is sourced from <i>Introduction to Algorithm</i> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. 
</P>
<P>
CODE_START Stack-empty(s) {    if s.top == 0 {      return true;    } else {      return false; } CODE_END 
</P>
<P>
<p></p> 
</P>
<P>
CODE_START Push(S,x){ 	// You can put an overflow check here 	s.top = s.top + 1; 	S[s.top] = x } CODE_END 
</P>
<P>
<p></p> 
</P>
<P>
CODE_START Pop(S) {        if Stack-empty(S) {        error "Underflow"        }else {		        s.top = s.top - 1;        return s[s.top + 1] }      	       CODE_END

Stacks find uses in a number of places, the most obvious place that comes to mind is the program stack. That is when a program is being executed and a function is called, the current state of execution is saved in the program stack and new element that represents the call to the called function is placed on the stack. When that function returns that record is popped of the stack. 
</P>
<P>
You can use stack as a data structure when you are doing a Depth First Search. They are also used in implementing a reverse polish notation calculator a good implementation of this can be found "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie.

 Problems you can think about 
</A>
</H1>
<P>
Write a function that takes in a set of integers and returns an integer with the lowest value in O(1).  
</P>
<P>
Also take a look at exercise 10.1-2 from the Cormen textbook.

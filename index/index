<h2>About this Site</h2>
<p>You have reached the part of the net which belongs to <b>Reuben
Francis Cornel</b>. This is <a href="mypic.jpg">what I look like</a> if you are interested.</p>

<h2>Organization of web pages</h2>
<p>This site is essentially meant to initiate people into
programming. As of now it does not have anything very deep about
the subjects mentioned. But in the future I intend to go deeper
into the subjects.</p>

<p>Most of the tutorial pages are organized as follows. It first
gives a brief introduction to the subject, then it says how to get
started with it. Once you know the basic and are interested in
going deeper then you can follow the links mentioned in the
resources section of the tutorial</p>

<h2>Contact Me</h2> 

<p> Please feel free to contact me for
clarifications. I may not be able to reply to every mail I receive. I
will try my best to reply to most of them. My email address is reuben
(dot) cornel (at) the google mail service.</p>

<p>
This page is still under development. I try and write whenever I have
the time. Sorry if you hit something that is not complete I will try
and complete this at the earliest.

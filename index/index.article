* Reuben's Webpage

So you have reached Reuben's part of the interwebs. I use this site to
talk about things I have done and teach things I have learned.

Navigating around this site is simple. The menu on the left gives you
access to all the main topics on the site, the menu on the left is the
contextual menu.

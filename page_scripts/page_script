TITLE:Scripts used to generate the pages
CONTENT_START:
BEGINP
I don't like using graphical front end tools for my web pages. I feel
they are an insult to whatever little intellect I have. I also hate
typing in HTML tags when I'm writing. It tends to distract you from
what you have in mind.
ENDP
BEGINP
So I came up with a simple solution. I wrote a set of scripts that
generate HTML. I simply write the contents in a simple text file. With
some simple markups. The scripts run on the file and generate the
necessary HTML which is checked up by "tidy".
ENDP
BEGINP
I felt that these scripts deserved a section on the site. The
scripts here are specifically customised for me. You can
download these scripts and modify them for your personal use.These
scripts have to be used ONLY UNDER THE GNU GPL License.
ENDP

BEGINP
Here is an explanation for all the scripts. The main shell script
first generates the header. Once the header is generated the text file
is streamed through <GLOSSARY sed>. Which generates most of the HTML. Then a perl
script is run over the newly generated file thus getting us the two
menus.
The main purpose of the <GLOSSARY AWK> script is for generating the <a
href="glossary.html">glossary</a> listing, apart from that this site has a 
<a href="whats_new.html">whats new</a> page which is also generated by an Awk script. The makepage.pl script is
used to create  the side menu bars. The second <GLOSSARY perl> script code.pl is
used to format code in the document with proper indentation.
ENDP

BEGINP
I have done a major revamp of the scripts on the website. As of now all HTML for new pages will be generated from a lisp script. Currently only the formatting of code sections is handled by a perl script. The reason for this change was mainly due to the fact that I had to learn lisp. But along the way I learnt quite a bit more. Will share these experiences as I go along. Currently the lisp script is not very nice...but I will keep on tuning it as I go ahead.
ENDP

BEGINP
I added photoalbum generation code to the main lisp script. In the input files I just specify the file names and the captions, the script takes care of generating the html in the right order.

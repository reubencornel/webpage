TITLE:UNIX Handouts
CONTENT_START:
BEGINP
I had an chance to give a set lectures(something which I love doing) to a set
of people at office. This set of lectures was on UNIX. If you know me,
you would know how passionate I am about this.
ENDP

BEGINP
So I decided to split up the task into 4 sessions. The intention of the
programme was to give the participants a firm grounding from where they
could go on their own, instead of spoon feeding them everything.
ENDP

BEGINP
When I was given the requirements for the sessions I decided that I
would split up the sessions as listed below.<br><br>

 Regular Expressions and Sed<br>
 Awk <br>
 Shell Programming <br>
 Perl <br>

ENDP

BEGINP
The most salient point of the entire exercise was that I used printed
handouts instead of the normal power point presentations. This was done
with the intention that people could use the handouts as reference
material later on.
ENDP

BEGINP
This was a right decision, I still get people telling me that was one of
the most innovative ideas they had seen in a  long time. The handouts helped
them a lot when they were actually writing some code for some project.
ENDP

BEGINP
There are two sets of handouts, one for the instructor and another for
the student. You can download a copy of the handouts from the menu of the right of
the page. 
ENDP

BEGINP
I have also written up a tutorial on using the "ed" text editor <a href="ed_tutorial.html">here</a>.

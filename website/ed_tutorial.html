<I>
This article by no means aims to give comprehensive information
about ed, instead it is meant to be a jumping point from where people
can take up things on their own.
</I>
</P>
<P>
An average programmer spends more than half his time working on
a text editor. The text editors used may vary from an ultra complex GUI text
editor like notepad++ with some really snazzy features or perhaps the
simple, humble, venerable vi.
</P>
<P>
The editors mentioned in the previous statement have one thing
in common they are screen editors. They show text as it is being
manipulated on the screen in real time.
</P>
<P>
But then there is a another class of editors which have almost
faded out of existence. These are line editors of yore. These editors
date back to the earliest computers, to a time when men were men and
used teletypes instead of CRTs. Examples of such editors would include
the ed editor in UNIX and edlin editor in dos. This article aims to
educate the reader about line editors. This article uses ed for its
examples.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few people question, as to why does such an editor like
ed exist in modern UNIX distributions and who would use them to do
anything?
</P>
<P>
One of the most important use of ed is to manipulate text in a
file through a set of instructions. This feature ed a very important
tool in any UNIX power users tool kit. For example, if you want to
make an entry into your profile to update your path variable with
another directory, you could either do this manually by opening the
profile files, making an entry and exporting the variables. Or write a
script that makes an entry into the file for you. Its in the second
case where ed shows its utility, we will see how this can be done
later in the article
</P>
<BR/>
<H2>
Getting started
</H2>
<P>
In this section I want you to get a feel of what it is to
interact directy with ed. We will look into the nitty gritties
later.
</P>
<P>
Ed like vi (actually vi like ed) has two different modes
</P>
<P>
<B>
Command Mode 
</B>
: Used to tell ed what you it want to do
</P>
<P>
<B>
Input Mode 
</B>
: Used to enter text
</P>
<P>
By default when you start ed, you are put into the command mode.
A set of commands (such as "a", "c") move you from command mode
into the input mode. For starters lets use ed to create a very simple
file
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a(enter)
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text(enter)
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text(enter)
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text(enter)
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.(enter)
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w(enter)
<br />
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
The set of command above are used to create a file called
testfile. Lets take apart the sequence of commands above. First on
line 2 you see "a". This tells ed to append text after the current
line. Once you hit "a" and then enter, you are put into input mode. Here
you can type text as if it were a normal editor the only restriction
being that once you hit an enter on a line you cannot go back to that
line. One line 7 you see a period. 
<I>
This tells ed to move you back into
the command mode.
</I>
 Now that you have typed your text you would like to
save it. The "w" on Line 8 does just that and the "q" quits ed.
</P>
<P>
Lets try another example
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,$p(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
In the example above we are opening the file and looking into
its contents. Notice when we open the file with the command on line 1
ed prints out the number of bytes in the file. On line 3 we give a
command to print all the lines in the file(More on this in the
addressing section. Finally on line 9 we quit the editor.
</P>
<P>
From the example above(line 3) we can observe a very important
point. That is how ed takes in its instructions. Almost all
instructions given to ed is in the format
</P>
<P>
<B>
(Address)(Command)
</B>
</P>
<P>
Since ed unlike other editors does not allow users to visually modify text. It provides an alternative means of doing so this is by means of using addresses. More about this in the addresses section
</P>
<P>
ed provides a set of commands that can be used to perform
almost any sort of modification that a person would do on a visual
editor. If you're familiar with vi this should be a breeze. Actually
from a historical perspective vi is a visual version of ed.
</P>
<P>
Finally lets try out one more example before we immerse
ourselves into the nitty gritties of ed.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H(enter)
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invalid Address
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
In the above example we try to access a line that does not
exist...and ed replies with a mysterious question mark...to figure out
the meaning of the question mark hit H and immediately you get the
cause of the problem. This example was meant to show how to deal with
ed when you encounter an error.
</P>
<BR/>
<H2>
Addressing
</H2>
<P>
Unlike visual editors a user cannot use arrow keys to move
around lines in a buffer in ed. Instead ed provides us with a
mechanism by which we specify the address of the line that line we
want to edit and ed modifies that line for us based on the
command. There are two types of addressing 
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Line Based Addressing:
</B>
</P>
<P>
The user specifies the line
number of the line that he wants to edit and ed uses that line to
apply its commands. The example below shows you how to move about a
file using line based addressing. We will use the test file created
above for all the examples.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
In the example above we see that on line 3 that the user hits 1
and ed replies by spitting out the first line in the text file. Now to
move to the next line the user can hit 2 and go on or he could simply
press a series of +'s and navigate the file. For example
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+(enter)
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
We can also jump a number of line relative to a given
line. This is illustrated in the example below .
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.+2(enter)
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
ed uses . to represent the current line its editing. So if type
in whats on line 5 what you are essentially doing is that you are
telling ed to move two lines from your current position. Once ed does
this it responds by displaying the text thats on that line.
</P>
<P>
An important thing to remember is that when ed loads a file
into memory the current line defaults to the last line in the
file. The dollar($) symbol represents the last line in any
file. Therefore sending a dollar to ed takes it to the last line.
</P>
<P>
A more concise way of refering to the idiom 1,$ is to use the %
symbol. Then instead of writing 1,$p you can simply write %p
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Context Based Addressing
</B>
</P>
<P>
ed also provides an alternate means of getting about a file,
this is done by specifying a pattern(regular expression) that must be
present in the 
line. Regular expressions are out of the scope of this tutorial, more
information and a good tutorial about these can be found at 
<A HREF = 'http://www.regular-expression.info' >
this site
</A>
. The example below illustrates a sample usage
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/lots(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
In the example in line 3 we specify that we want a line that
contains lots and ed jumps to that line and prints it on the screen.
</P>
<P>
I almost missed another point about addresses, you can specify
a range of addresses over which you want your commands to work on,
these ranges could consist completly of line number based addressing
or context based addresses. For example if you want to print all the
lines in a file you could possibly type the following.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,$p
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<BR/>
<H2>
Commands
</H2>
<P>
ed provides a number of commands using which you can edit your
text file. I have listed only the ones I have used the most in all my
scripts. As mentioned earlier, please look into the manual page for a
more comprehensive listing.
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Printing Lines
</B>
</P>
<P>
We have seen enough of printing lines I will not explain this
any further. Honestly I'm fed up of just printing lines.
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Appending Lines
</B>
</P>
<P>
The "a" command appends lines after the current line. The
example below illustrates this.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,$p(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a(enter)
<br />
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is some more text(enter)
<br />
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.(enter)
<br />
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,$p(enter)
<br />
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some text
<br />
14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is some more text
<br />
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some more text
<br />
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more text
<br />
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lots more text
<br />
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
The change in the buffer is obvious but notice that I have used
"Q" instead of "q". The capital q tells ed to quit with out
saving.
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Inserting Lines
</B>
</P>
<P>
The code section below shows the usage and effect of the "i"
command.

Deleting Lines
</B>
</P>
<P>
The code section below illustrates how lines can be deleted
from a file. Please note the usage of address ranges.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)

12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
<B>
Writing to files
</B>
</P>
<P>
The code section below illustrates how files are written in
ed.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a(enter)
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is some more text(enter)
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.(enter)
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w(enter)
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
ed also allows you to write a section of a buffer to another
file the example below illustrates the same. The example below also
illustrates the usage of ranges.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,3w testfile1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
<B>
Substitution
</B>
</P>
<P>
This would be one of the most important reasons why you would
use ed. Its syntax is as follows.
</P>
<P>
<B>
s/pattern/replacement/option
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>
pattern:
</B>
is a regular expression pattern that needs to
be substituted
</P>
<P>
<B>
replacement:
</B>
is the text that would be replaceing the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
<B>
option:
</B>
 is used to modify the behaviour of the
substitute command.
</P>
<P>
 The most commonly used option is g. This tells
substitute to replace every occurence of the regular expression in the
text. Otherwise by default ed replaces only the first expression. The
"p" option can be used to look at the result of the
substitution. The example below illustrates just that.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ ed testfile(enter)
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1(enter)
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s/text/lines/gp(enter)
<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some lines
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w(enter)
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q(enter)
<br />
</div><BR/>
<H2>
Examples
</H2>
<P>
Now for the interesting part. I have put in two examples of
what you could do with ed.
</P>
<BR/>
<P>
<B>
Example 1
</B>
</P>
<P>
The first example is trivial, it shows how you can remove the
first line from a file, this seems easy but this is the most common
thing that people when scripting come around asking for help. The tiny
script below does just that.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "1d
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" | ed testfile
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
<B>
Example 2
</B>
</P>
<P>
The example below is a actual script I use at home if I want to
add a new directory to my existing path variable.
</P>
<BR/>
<div id="navCode">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#!/bin/bash
<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if [ $# -ne 1 ];
<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then
<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Usage: $0 &lt;path to be added&gt;"<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit 0
<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
<br />
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathToBeAdded=$1
<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "1
<br />
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%/export PATH/d
<br />
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br />
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a
<br />
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH=$pathToBeAdded:$PATH
<br />
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export PATH
<br />
14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
<br />
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w
<br />
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q" | ed ~.bashrc
<br />
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "1
<br />
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%/export PATH/d
<br />
19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br />
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a
<br />
21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH=$pathToBeAdded:$PATH
<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export PATH
<br />
23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
<br />
24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w
<br />
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q" | ed ~/.bash_profile
<br />
</div><BR/>
<P>
In the example above, we first delete all lines that export the
PATH variable, we then go to the end of the file (line 10 and 19) and
append our addition into the .bashrc and .bash_profile.
</P>
<P>

Please do send me comments about this tutorial, it would help
me improve this as well as the ones I write in the future. Cheers

I had an chance to give a set lectures(something which I love doing) to a set
of people at office. This set of lectures was on UNIX. If you know me,
you would know how passionate I am about this.
</p><br />

<p>
So I decided to split up the task into 4 sessions. The intention of the
programme was to give the participants a firm grounding from where they
could go on their own, instead of spoon feeding them everything.
</p><br />

<p>
When I was given the requirements for the sessions I decided that I
would split up the sessions as listed below.<br><br>

 Regular Expressions and Sed<br>
 Awk <br>
 Shell Programming <br>
 Perl <br>

</p><br />

<p>
The most salient point of the entire exercise was that I used printed
handouts instead of the normal power point presentations. This was done
with the intention that people could use the handouts as reference
material later on.
</p><br />

<p>
This was a right decision, I still get people telling me that was one of
the most innovative ideas they had seen in a  long time. The handouts helped
them a lot when they were actually writing some code for some project.
</p><br />

<p>
There are two sets of handouts, one for the instructor and another for
the student. You can download a copy of the handouts from the menu of the right of
the page.

I have also written up a tutorial on using the "ed" text editor <a href="ed_tutorial.html">here</a>.

<p>
    This is another problem which at least I faced pretty regularly. I
    have a monitor that can support a resolution of 1024x768
    pixels. But the setup detected the resolution wrong as a result I
    had  a resolution of 800x600. Apart from that sometimes a few of
    my friends tried increasing the resolution of the monitor to a
    point which the monitor could not support as as result X windows
    would not start up.
</p><br />

<p>
    All the remedies to these maladies lie in the X windows
    configuration file. It can be found in the "/etc/X11" directory
    with the name "XF86Config*"(use reg ex) . Open the file using your
    favourite text editor. 
</p><br />

<p>
    Search for a section called "Screen". Once found add a subsection
    after the "DefaultDepth" entry. As follows (the entry given here
    is for me make modification to suit your hardware).
</p><br />

    	SubSection "Display"<br/>
	&nbsp&nbsp	Depth		24<br/>
	&nbsp&nbsp	Modes		"1024x768"<br/>
	EndSubSection<br/>
<p>
    restart X windows.
</p><br />
<p>
    If you can't get to text mode because the xserver does not let you
    get there in that case you can get into run level 3(text multiuser
    mode) from the the grub prompt. To do this as soon as you get the
    GRUB screen select the line which you want to boot and press 'e'
</p><br />
<p>
    This will take you to a screen where the first line will be the
    partition which will be booted. The next line will generally be
    the kernel which be booted. Select this line again and press 'e'
    you to a prompt with the same line. Here get to the end of the
    line and type '3' and hit enter. You will be taken to the previous
    screen. Now press "b" to boot. Then  login as root and modify the
    XF86Config file.

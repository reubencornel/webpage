<h2>
YATE - Yet Another Text Editor
</h2>
<p>
This project is one of my all time favourite projects. It was
developed in my 5th semester and is the biggest of all my 
projects. It
is about 6000 lines of C++ code. Its main features are that it is
completely menu based although all menu choices have appropriate
shortcuts. It has an inbuilt spell checking system. In the following
sections I will discuss how these could be implemented.

<h2>
Design Decisions
</h2>
<p>
This is probably the most important part of any project. It decides
the entire structure of your project. If your design is good not only
will you be able to complete the project on time, moreover your code
will be stable and reusable.
</p><br />
<p>
To start off, I decided I had to do my project in C++. There was one
main reason that affected this decision. It was that C++ was object
oriented which considerably reduces complexity of the
project. Moreover the Standard Template Library  <a href="glossary.html#STL">STL</a> 
of C++
made short work of all the coding in the project.
</p><br />
<p>
Next I decided on a data structure. I choose a list of lists as the
data structure for the text editor. Though I don't remember why 
I chose
it but I did definitely experiment with other data structures 
like a
single list etc..
I will discuss the main classes in my editor in the following sections
</p><br />

<div class="content">
<h2>
The Menu Class
</h2>
<p>
I had to choose between the menu library
provided my ncurses or write my own. I chose the later as the library
provided by ncurses did not satisfy my specific requirements. So I
wrote a simple menu class that took in a list of strings as an
argument, the number of strings, the x and y position of the 
menu as
constructor arguments. Once this was done all I had to do was I 
had to
call a method called GetChoice() which returned the selected 
number to
me. I did not bother about saving the portion of the screen on which
the menu was drawn as I could refresh the text below and the 
menu would
disappear. It was much more simple than saving that portion of the
screen in the memory and redrawing it back.
</p><br />

<div class="content">
<h2>
The File System Browser
</h2>
<p>
As in any text editor I had a File system browser. This was 
again a
simple class that displayed all the files in a directory. I used the
up and down arrow keys for selection. It returned the name of 
the file
that had been selected with the full path.
</p><br />

</div>

<div class="content">
<h2>
The Dialog Class
</h2>
<p>
This class was used to display simple dialog boxes to display
information and take input from users if there was a need for it.
</p><br />

</div>

<div class="content">
<h2>
The Data structure Class
</h2>
<p>
The data structure was implemented as a class. The main reason 
for this
was that I could have multiple instances of this class to edit
multiple files. Thats how I implemented editing multiple files 
at once
in different instances of the data structure class. This also 
had a
display module. It had an interface which communicated with the spell
checker class. All list manipulation was the work of this
class. Whenever a key hit was detected by the interface and if 
the key
was not a shortcut the keyhit() method of the data structure of the
class was called which called the appropriate function.
</p><br />

</div>

<div class="content">
<h2>
The Spell Checker.
</h2>
<p>
This is an absolutely brilliant class. I love it, because it was so
simple. When somebody wanted the buffer spell checked the data
structure created a new instance of the spell checker class. Then
every line was converted from a C++ list to a simple C string and
passed to the spell checker class that did the modification on the
string and passed the modified string back. This was then 
updated in
the data structure.
</p><br />
<p>
I used the <b>pspell</b> spell checker library for the spell 
checker engine.

<h2>
Reading Material
</h2>
<p>
I hope you are confortable with STL otherwise you can read <b>Herbert
Schiltd's - Complete C++ Reference</b>
</p><br />
<p>
For starters on curses I suggest you start up by reading 
<b>Pradeep Padala's -
Ncurses Programming HOWTO</b>. 
</p><br />
<p>
I suggest you buy a copy of <b>The Linux Programming Bible - John
Goerzen</b>. I find this an extremely useful and a well written book
which covers nearly all aspects of programming in Linux.

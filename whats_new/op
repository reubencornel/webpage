SEPAs you can see I am beginning to change the typography on the website so as to make it more readable. I have changed the font to georgia that should be available on almost all computers. I have also changed the color of the font to black for higher contrast with the background. I have also set the line spacing to 1.5 em so as to give more space between lines. More changes coming soon!!!

This is quite a major update to the site. I've put up a photo album and a cooking section on the website. I've fixed the fonts. Made a whole lot of changes to the backend....etc...etc... This would be a major version release if this was software.

communication group.

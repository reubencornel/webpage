SEPAs you can see I am beginning to change the typography on the website so as to make it more readable. I have changed the font to georgia that should be available on almost all computers. I have also changed the color of the font to black for higher contrast with the background. I have also set the line spacing to 1.5 em so as to give more space between lines. More changes coming soon!!!

This is quite a major update to the site. I've put up a photo album and a cooking section on the website. I've fixed the fonts. Made a whole lot of changes to the backend....etc...etc... This would be a major version release if this was software.

Well...here it a change after ages...I hope I'm able to make an entry into this page more frequently. I have made some major changes, the backend HTML will be generated by a lisp script. I have also added a tutorial on ed. This is something that I wanted to do for quite a while, it can be found <a href="ed_tutorial.html">here</a>

Ah...This update was long overdue, I've put in a miscellaneous section.
I will be expanding this further. But for now I have only a section on 
the <a href="k1000_rally.html">Karnataka 1000 rally</a> for which I volunteered as a member of the 
communication group.
